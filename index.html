           <p>An M.S. in Big Data Analytics alongside a Bachelors Graduate in Computer Science, I'm always looking for the next project to work on.
             I have completed a variety of projects throughout my time in education and industry, working

                     to successfully solve problems in the computing world through efficient Programming.
                     As someone with no programming background prior, I worked on the languages of C#, Python, SQL, Data Mining and Linux Based Systems.

                    With the combination of a new environment and new culture, I embraced a new way of thinking which helped me to expand my knowledge and experience.

            <p> During my final year at the University of Hull, I worked on my Honours Dissertation on the topic of Sentiment Analysis.
              With the combined use of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Word Embeddings, training and classification of tweets is successfully implemented with good results. Variations in trainable data demonstrated that removal of stopwords, can have a negative effect on classification accuracy.
              Indexing and Tokenization are used effectively to feed data into Neural Networks. Results are evaluated based on data trained alongside different type of hidden layers across Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

            <p>For my Masters Degree, I was tasked with developing a smart recommendation system that takes a Music Library and gives the user the ability to search for songs by word, artists by name and compare songs / artists by numerical IDs.
              Using the Metrics of Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance, Pearson Correlation, Cosine Similarity and Jaccard Similarity, the user is given the option to choose a suitable Metric and compare either two songs or two artists.
              This project is complete and uploaded to my GitHub. It includes added functionality to provide recommendations to a user based on an entered ID.

            <p>As part of my 3rd year at the University of Hull, I worked on a project involving Legacy Medical Data Mining.
              Following the CRISP-DM methodology, the task here was to explore, define and work with Data to determine if it is possible to predict if a patient
              will be at risk or not based on the Data we have. This was done by creating a variety of Models in Data Science such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbours and Nueral Networks, tuning the hyper-parameters of these to suite the purpose.
